# CSE-163-Project

This is for CSE 163 final project contributed by Bill Li and Alyssa Allums.

Core questions this project will answer:

1) What relationships exist between each state’s political leanings and their economic growth? Does control of a state government by a certain political party help or hinder economic growth? We are trying to determine if there is a correlation between the economic success of a state and its political leaders and if any political agenda lends itself better to that economic success. These calculations would be critical in our ability to predict future economic success or failure.

2) To what degree do demographics of a state (urban vs rural, population) affect economic growth? What relationship exists between each state’s demographics and their political leaning? We are trying to determine if there is a relationship between the economic growth in each state and the demographics of the state. If there is a relationship, we can predict the economic growth of each state with changes in the demographics.
      
3) Can political leaning and demographics be used to predict the economic status of a state? We are trying to determine whether political leaning is an accurate means to predict economic status. If it is, this would be useful to predict the economic status of states in the future based on their political party. It would also help to see which states, based on their political leaning, will flourish or decline economically.
